# Major Inconsistencies Identified

## Automated Test Failures
Running `pytest tests/test_ab_testing.py tests/test_agents.py` surfaces widespread failures (16 failing tests out of 81). 【801c23†L1-L93】 These span the A/B testing module, intelligent agents, and end-to-end pipeline, indicating systemic reliability issues.

## Visualization Utilities Assume Real Matplotlib Objects
The plotting helpers inside `MetricsComparator` unconditionally unpack the return value of `plt.subplots` and call seaborn, which fails when `plt` is patched to a mock (as done in the tests). 【F:automl_platform/ab_testing.py†L266-L344】【801c23†L1-L32】 The tests crash before asserting results, meaning the comparison utilities are unusable under common testing setups.

## A/B Testing Service API and Lifecycle Bugs
`ABTestingService.create_ab_test` omits support for the `min_improvement` argument expected by callers, producing a `TypeError`. 【F:automl_platform/ab_testing.py†L526-L551】【801c23†L32-L48】 Moreover, `conclude_test` deletes the configuration before the final summary is assembled, so `get_test_results` raises `KeyError` for concluded experiments. 【F:automl_platform/ab_testing.py†L684-L746】【801c23†L32-L62】 These defects prevent automated evaluation of experiments and promotion workflows.

## Context Detector Scoring and Configuration Robustness
The context detector’s scoring heuristic tops out at ~0.63 for the provided fraud example, below the expected confidence threshold, because the context boost only matches exact strings. 【F:automl_platform/agents/intelligent_context_detector.py†L421-L452】【801c23†L62-L77】 In addition, `_generate_optimal_config` forwards `data_characteristics` dictionaries that may lack `n_features`, leading to a `KeyError` during algorithm selection. 【F:automl_platform/agents/intelligent_context_detector.py†L500-L571】【801c23†L77-L84】 Together these prevent the agent from producing stable configurations on simple inputs.

## Config Generator Defaults Misaligned With Tests
The intelligent config generator still defaults fraud problems to the `average_precision` metric and uses only three CV folds for small datasets, contradicting documented expectations. 【F:automl_platform/agents/intelligent_config_generator.py†L409-L447】【F:automl_platform/agents/intelligent_config_generator.py†L730-L772】【801c23†L84-L103】 As a result, even the basic generation test fails.

## Adaptive Template System Initialization and Learning Gaps
`AdaptiveTemplateSystem.get_configuration` references `base_config` before assignment and `_select_best_learned_pattern` enforces a high similarity threshold, returning `None` even when close matches exist. 【F:automl_platform/agents/adaptive_template_system.py†L82-L140】【801c23†L103-L123】 Subsequent learning logic stores duplicates without deduplication, so pattern counts diverge from expectations. 【F:automl_platform/agents/adaptive_template_system.py†L329-L413】【801c23†L123-L149】 These issues block the agent from reusing prior knowledge.

## Universal Agent Hashing and Reporting Logic
The universal agent’s `_compute_data_hash` only considers schema metadata, so different datasets with identical shapes hash to the same value. Its execution summary sums `dict_values` objects, causing a `TypeError`. 【F:automl_platform/agents/universal_ml_agent.py†L652-L688】【801c23†L84-L123】 Downstream pipeline tests therefore fail, and caching cannot distinguish similar datasets.

## Data Cleaning Orchestrator Never Chunks Small Inputs
Chunking relies on dataset size exceeding a static threshold, so the orchestrator always returns a single chunk for the small synthetic dataset used in tests, violating expected behaviour. 【F:automl_platform/agents/data_cleaning_orchestrator.py†L364-L377】【801c23†L123-L149】 This prevents parallel cleaning for modest datasets.

## End-to-End Pipeline Reliability
The end-to-end fraud pipeline fails outright with `'str' object has no attribute "isoformat"'`, and the learning pipeline records an unexpected number of patterns, demonstrating that the orchestrated workflow is currently unstable. 【801c23†L149-L188】 Until these systemic errors are resolved, the platform cannot deliver consistent agent-driven automation.
